# AERSP_424_Final_Project
NOTE FOR ANY GRADERS: Although the code will work for any arrival orbit in the catalog, there is no guarantee that any orbit will result in successfull transfers within the bounds of the problem. If any grader wants to test the full extent of the project, the following inputs will result in transfers that are catalogued and visualized: Measurement input = 1 | Orbit_Type = LYAPUNOV_L1 | Orbit_Number = 40. Warning: The runtime for these conditions is about XXX minutes...


Description:
This purpose of this function is to design transfers from a spacecraft in a Earth-bound orbit to a Cislunar orbit around the L1 and L2 points. The function will begin by prompting the user for the following inputs: file name for the catalog output; measurement number based on the... 



Dependent Functions: 

Main Function:
The Main function will prompt the user to input the measurements and their choice of arrival orbit. This function will utilize classes to store the data. It will also call the function to generate the transfers

IOD Function class:
  This class will take the user input of the measurement set and create an object with the position and velocity of the spacecraft as the attributes.
  
  IOD_Measurement Function:
  Collecting the terms from the user for the initial spacecraft measurements. For simplicity, the measurements are stored in text files and the user can specify which measurements   they want. The attributes of azimuth, elevation, position of the viewing site, and time of the viewing will be attached to an object within this class.
  
  Gauss Function:
  This function will intake the measurements to solve for a distance to the spacecraft along with additional terms needed for the rest of the calculations. This function will also   need an additional Root_Finding function
  
  Root_Finding Function (Used online sources to help since the Boost and Eigen built-in functions didnâ€™t work): 
  This function utilizes Newton-Raphson iterations to solve for the real positive root of the octic polynomial function
  
  Position Function: 
  This function will find the position vectors of all three measurements
  
  Gibbs Functions:
  This function will find the velocity that corresponds to one of the position vectors.

Arrival_Orbit class:
Takes the input of the orbit type and orbit number from the catalog and finds the initial conditions and orbital period for the chosen orbit and sets these attributes to an object

Transfer Function

Generating Manifold Initial Conditions Function:
This function will generate the initial conditions for the manifold. The use of threads will be partially helpful here since the function uses a For Loop where they are not dependent on each other
Generating the Poincare Section Function:
To ensure the manifold stops at the plane of the Earth, this function will use a basic differential corrections (single shooting) scheme to ensure the manifold will only be propagated for the correct time. Similar to the previous function, the use of threads will be really helpful in speeding up the computational time since each branch of the manifold is independent of each other.
Manifold Hits the Moon Function:
This function will be used to ensure that no parts of the manifold hits the Moon. Any branch that hits the Moon will not be considered moving forward in the program
Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) to Rotating Coordinate Frame Transformation Function:
It is assumed that the measurements of the spacecraft are found in the ECI coordinate system. Since the position and velocity will be used in later parts of the project (as a constraint and to calculate the final delta_v), it must be converted to the frame the dynamics are in, which is the rotating body frame
Getting the Initial Guess for delta_v and TOF:
This function will utilize a brute force shotgunning method of finding a better initial guess for delta_v and TOF. Same as the manifold and Poincare section functions, the use of threads will be really helpful in speeding up the computational time since each combination of delta_v and TOF are independent of each other. They only need to save the final position of each to compare at the end of the shotgunning method. Whichever guess is closest to the position of the satellite will be used for differential corrections in the next function
Differential Corrections Function: 
This function will be the culmination of all the previous functions. It will require the use of the position of the spacecraft as a constraint, the manifold as an initial position and velocity, and the guess of delta_v and TOF as initial guesses for the shooting scheme. For each iteration of the function, it will propagate the equations of motion, compute the error, and determine how much to change the initial conditions by. The function will end once the error is below some tolerance. The function will then rerun for the next branch of the manifold using the previous converged solution as the first initial guess. 
Output_Function
This function will serve as a way to both output and store the converged solution to a text file
Transfer_Visualization Function:
The final function will be used for the visualization of the transfer based on the outputs from the Transfer function
