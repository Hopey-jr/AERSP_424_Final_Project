# AERSP_424_Final_Project
TO PROFESSOR MILLER:
The problem is with the hits_moon_check and processing_negative/processing_positive functions/files. I spent last night trying to work through different versions of this code and used a couple different sources (chatgpt and stackoverflow) to put this together and it might've made me more confused. Running the code without threads works fine but with breaks it.
